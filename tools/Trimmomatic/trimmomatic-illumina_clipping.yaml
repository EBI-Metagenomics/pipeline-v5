  - name: adapters
    type: File
    doc: |
      FASTA file containing adapters, PCR sequences, etc. It is used to search
      for and remove these sequences in the input FASTQ file(s)
  - name: seedMismatches
    type: int
    doc: |
      specifies the maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full match
      to be performed
  - name: palindromeClipThreshold
    type: int
    doc: |
      specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads
      must be for PE palindrome read alignment.
  - name: simpleClipThreshold
    type: int
    doc: |
      specifies how accurate the match between any adapter etc. sequence must
      be against a read
  - name: minAdapterLength
    type: int?

      In addition to the alignment score, palindrome mode can verify that a
      minimum length of adapter has been detected. If unspecified, this
      defaults to 8 bases, for historical reasons. However, since palindrome
      mode has a very low false positive rate, this can be safely reduced, even
      down to 1, to allow shorter adapter fragments to be removed.

      After read-though has been detected by palindrome mode, and the adapter
      sequence removed, the reverse read contains the same sequence information
      as the forward read, albeit in reverse complement. For this reason, the
      default behaviour is to entirely drop the reverse read. By specifying
      "true" for this parameter, the reverse read will also be retained, which
      may be useful e.g. if the downstream tools cannot handle a combination of
      paired and unpaired reads.
